Hi
this is a text based rpg that prints out in your
command line, type in commands based off
of suggestions that appear on your screen
and then hit enter to enter them

interact with people buy their goods when they have
them for cheap, sell them to people that are buying them high
in order to make money
you must sleep in either the tavern on the cot or
in the hotel on the bed or else you will pass out from exhaustion

call python Games.py to run the program

helpful commands in game if you get stuck or don't understand
when asked for a yes or no y works for yes in addition to yes
when asked for a yes or no n works for no in addition to no
n also works for north when not interacting with anyone
s also works for south when not interacting with anyone
w also works for west when not interacting with anyone
e also works for east when not interacting with anyone
to go back type q, quit, or back

have fun playing
