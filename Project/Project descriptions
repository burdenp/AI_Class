Hotel Description:
"What appears to be an old monastarey converted to appeal to softer tastes, everything is drapped in tapestries, vivid velvet fabrics coving walls from end to end, at the one corner of the room is a collection of couches, the center of the room has a desk with a bell on it and a sign that says concierge"

North Market:
"A collection of fabric tents set up quickly over a vast array of vendors and their goods, the exotic smells confused the mind and the confusion of the chaos of commerce creates a clamorous cacophony, that draws in a seemingly endless supply of buyers and their coin."

Tavern:
"An old building with tables grouped together filled with boisterous patrons, a tavernkeeper stands behind a bar keeping his keep, as barmaids service the rowdy folk at their tables."

Gate:
"A large Wooden draw bridge with a portculis in the gate way, a company of guards stand watch"

Market Center:
"A collection of shops cover the street as people slowly move around with various bizarre and fantastic items ranging from flaming birds in cages, to shurnken heads, to marvelous pastries. Shop signs display foreign words and intricate caligraphy"

Dock:
"A working dock where ships load and unload goods in masse to merchants in the city to sell. Workers handle giant boxes carrying them on and off the dock. Sailors prep their boats for their next voyage."

Capital:
"Guards stand in front of an officail looking building with a seal on the fron with an insignia over it"

South Market:
"People stand around on the sidewalk at imprompt shops shouting their wares at each other, screaming for attention of the nearest person with money trying to hopefully peddal some of their wares for the day."

Shanty Town:
"Dingy makeshift part of a city, buildings made of combinations of fabric, wood, stone, and sheet metal."
